# rater193's public utility script repository 
 
 This repo is going to be full of scripts that i personally have created, or re-used. I will try to also document whatever scripts i add that are not created by me, to give you references to where you can go to learn more about the script itself. But for the majority of the scripts, i will be making them myself.
